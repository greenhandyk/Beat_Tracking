# Beat_Tracking
Real-time Beat Tracking for LED Cube used for Final year thesis
# Off-Line Result 
step 1:Run Tempo_detection.py which is used for getting dynamic tempo  
step 2:Run Offline_Beattracking.py which is used for getting the result of the new methods  
step 3:Run the jupyter notebook follow the code in Evaluation.py to do the result comparision 
# Raspberry Pi side code
choice 1: use the madmom code discussed in Yikai's Thesis  
choice 2: use Real_time_BT.py
# Arduino Hardware part  
step 1: build Hardware connection in Yikai's Thesis  
step 2: you need to download the driver code in  https://github.com/aguegu  
step 3: run the arduino LED_main_control  
# Data information
