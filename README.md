# Package installation
Lots of packages needed to install, all mentioned in the Final year thesis's appendix part
# Beat_Tracking
Real-time Beat Tracking for LED Cube used for Final year thesis
# Off-Line Result 
step 1:Run Tempo_detection.py which is used for getting dynamic tempo  
step 2:Run Offline_Beattracking.py which is used for getting the result of the new methods  
step 3:Run the jupyter notebook follow the code in Evaluation.py to do the result comparision 
# Raspberry Pi side code
choice 1: use the madmom code discussed in Yikai's Thesis  
choice 2: use Real_time_BT.py
# Arduino Hardware part  
step 1: build Hardware connection mentioned in Yikai's Thesis  
step 2: you need to download the driver code in dot-matrix https://github.com/aguegu based on the arduino include function  
step 3: run the arduino LED_main_control.h  
# Data information
Data come from 2017 IEEE Signal Processing Cup 25 open songs, 25 closed songs, and 33 challenge songs.  
The reference beat time dataset download from 2017 IEEE Signal Processing Cup official website
